                <p>
                    Japan’s Mt. Fuji is an active volcano about 100 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. Commonly called “Fuji-san,” 
                    it’s the country’s tallest peak, at 3,776 meters. A pilgrimage site for centuries, it’s considered one of 
                    Japan’s 3 sacred mountains, and summit hikes remain a popular activity.

                <p>
                    Fushimi Inari Taisha is an important Shinto shrine in southern Kyoto. It is famous for its thousands of 
                    vermilion torii gates, which straddle a network of trails behind its main buildings. The trails lead into 
                    the wooded forest of the sacred Mount Inari, which stands at 233 meters and belongs to the shrine grounds.
